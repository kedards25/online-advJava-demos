Servlets help us to run java code on server side
Servlet class inherits HttpServlet
We need to override two methods from HttpServlet
	doGet-->get method of form submission
	doPost-->post method of form submission

LifeCycle of servlet
	1.conversion of .java to .class
	2.loading .class file in web container of server
	3.creating instance of .class
	4.init method to initialize the instance of the class
	5.service method to process request and generate output
	6.destroy method to destroy the reference of .class file

url-mapping specifies the invocation of servlet when particular pattern in mentioned in url of project

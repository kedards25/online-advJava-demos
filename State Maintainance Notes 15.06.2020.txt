State Maintainance=Keeping track of the user activity in current session

HTTP Protocol is stateless protocol>->it does not keep track of user activity

so in order to maintain state of the user we have to write code either on client or on server side

Following features help us to maintain state of the user
hidden field
session
cookie
url-rewriting

Hidden Field
	data is saved in tag named as input type="hidden"
	can be accessed on client side
	hence can be modified very easily
	not secure

Session
	Helps you to maintain data set on one page on all the pages 	throughout the application
	has a method named as getSession() which accepts boolean 	value as a parameter whose default value is true which states 	that session has to be created whereas param value as false 
	states that existing session has to be used 
	if session is not created it throws an error/raises an 	exception	

Cookie
	Helps you save client details in form of text file on the 	browser
	It is set on server side but is sent on client along with 	response
	Types of Cookies
		Temporary Cookies(Cookies with expiration time)
		Permanant Cookies(Cookies without expiration time)
	As cookies are set on client browser memory,it can be 	tampered very easily and hence it is not secure

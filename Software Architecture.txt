Design	=>PL->Presentation Layer
Logic	=>BL->Bussiness Layer
DB	=>DL->Data Layer

On basis of the part where all the layers are residing
we have software architecture

Single Tier/One tier architecture
	PL	BL	DL
	all the three layers reside on single machine

	Pro's
		Performance will be faster
		less maintainance cost
		no need of network

	Con's
		Storage issue
		restricted to one user per machine
		Storage affects performance
		System failure	
		no backup facility
		
Two Tier architecture
	PL+BL		DL
	client		Server architecture

	Pro's
		Multi-user oriented
		Data Backup facility
		High performance
		Maintance is modular
		Remote access

	Con's
		High maintainance cost
		Performance is user dependant
		in case of update,each client needs to be visited
		or sent to the server

	Fat Client	Thin server
	PL+BL		DL
	client		Server architecture

	Thin client 	Fat Server
	PL		BL+DL



		
Three Tier architecture
	PL		BL		DL
	
	Pro's		
		Modularity
		OTA update

	Con's
		for each request client has to take
		round trip from the server
		which delays the performance and
		provokes user to move to another platform

N-tier architecture
	PL		BL		DL
		AJAX		Disc
				Env
	helps to handle		helps to connect to
	small requests 		virtual DB
	asynchronously		in order to keep
	(partial page updation)	actual DB free
